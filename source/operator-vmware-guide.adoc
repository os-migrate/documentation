= VMware to OpenStack Guide

An important function included in OS Migrate is our VMware tooling,
which allows you to migrate a virtual machine from an ESXi/Vcenter environment
to OpenStack environments.

The code used os-migrate Ansible collection in order to deploy conversion host and setup
correctly the prerequists in the Openstack destination cloud.
It also used the vmware community collection in order to gather informations from the source
VMWare environment.

The Ansible collection provides different steps to scale your migration from VMWare to Openstack:

* A discovery phase where it analizes the VMWare source environment and provides collected data
to help for the migration.
* A pre-migration phase where it make sure the destionation cloud is ready to perform the migration,
by creating the conversion host for example or the required network if needed.
* A migration phase with different workflow where the user can basicaly scale the migration with
a very number of virtual machines as entry point, or can migrate sensitive virtual machine by using
a near zero down time with the change block tracking VMWare option (CBT) and so perform the virtual
machine migration in two steps. The migration can also be done without conversion host.

== Workflow

There is different ways to run the migration from VMWare to OpenStack.

* The default is by using nbdkit server with a conversion host (an Openstack instance hosted in the destination cloud).
This way allow the user to use the CBT option and approach a zero downtime. It can also run the migration in one time cycle.
* The second one by using virt-v2v binding with a conversion host. Here you can use a conversion
host (Openstack instance) already deployed or you can let OS-Migrate deployed a conversion host
for you.
* A third way is available where you can skip the conversion host and perform the migration on a Linux machine, the volume
migrated and converted will be upload a Glance image or can be use later as a Cinder volume. This way is not recommended if
you have big disk or a huge amount of VMs to migrate: the performance are really slower than with the other ways.

All of these are configurable with Ansible boolean variables.

=== Nbdkit migration example

image::images/osm-migration-nbdkit-vmware-workflow-with-osm.drawio.svg[Ndbkit]


=== Nbdkit migration example with the Change Block Tracking

==== Step 1: The data are copied and the change ID from the VMware disk are set to the Cinder volume as metadata

[NOTE]
====
The conversion cannot be made at this moment, and the OS instance is not created.
This functionality can be used for large disks with a lot of data to transfer. It helps avoid a prolonged service interruption.

image::images/osm-migration-nbdkit-vmware-workflow-with-osm_cbt_step1.svg[CBT Step 1]

==== Step 2: OSM compare the source (VMware disk) and the destination (Openstack Volume) change ID

[NOTE]
====
If the change IDs are not equal, the changed blocks between the source and destination are synced.
Then, the conversion to libvirt/KVM is triggered, and the OpenStack instance is created.
This allows for minimal downtime for the VMs.
====

image::images/osm-migration-nbdkit-vmware-workflow-with-osm_cbt_step2.svg[CBT Step 2]


=== Using Change Block Tracking (CBT)

The Change Block Tracking (CBT) option allows you to pre-synchronize the disk data and then copy only the blocks that have changed between runs. OS-Migrate records the CBT ID as metadata on the Cinder volume so it can perform delta syncs.

[source,bash]
----
openstack volume show rhel-9 | grep properties
# Example output:
# | properties | changeID='52 64 3d 2e .../138', converted='false', osm='true' |
----

In this example:

* `converted=false` means cutover has not happened yet.
* `osm=true` means the volume is managed by OS-Migrate.

To enable CBT synchronization and later perform the cutover:

[source,yaml]
----
import_workloads_cbt_sync: true
----

When ready to migrate the VM, perform the final cutover:

[source,yaml]
----
import_workloads_cutover: true
----


=== VMware ACLs requirements

To avoid using the Administrator role and still be able to connect, parse the vCenter datastore, manipulate snapshots, and migrate VMs, ensure the vCenter user has at least these privileges:

|===
| Category | Privilege Group | Privileges

| Datastore |  | Browse datastore

| Virtual Machine | Guest operations | All
|  | Provisioning | Allow disk access; Allow file access; Allow read-only disk access; Allow virtual machine download
|  | Service configuration | Allow notifications; Allow polling of global event notifications; Read service configuration
|  | Snapshot management | Create snapshot; Remove snapshot; Rename snapshot; Revert to snapshot
|===

=== Running migration

==== Conversion host

You can use os_migrate.os_migration collection to deploy a conversion, but you can
easily create your conversion host manually.

A conversion host is basically an OpenStack instance.

[NOTE]
====
Important: If you want to take benefit of the current supported OS, it's highly recommended to use a *CentOS-10* release or *RHEL-9.5* and superior. If you want to use other Linux distribution, make sure the virtio-win package is equal or higher than 1.40 version.

[source,bash]
----
curl -O -k https://cloud.centos.org/centos/10-stream/x86_64/images/CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-10-20250217.0.x86_64.qcow2

# Create OpenStack image:
openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --file CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-10-20250217.0.x86_64.qcow2 CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-10-20250217.0.x86_64.qcow2

# Create flavor, security group and network if needed
openstack server create --flavor x.medium --image 14b1a895-5003-4396-888e-1fa55cd4adf8  \
  --key-name default --network private   vmware-conv-host
openstack server add floating ip vmware-conv-host 192.168.18.205
----

==== VMware VDDK setup

===== Download and extract the VMware VDDK

. In a browser, navigate to the VMware VDDK download page.
. Select version 8.0.1 and download the archive.
. Save the archive in a temporary directory and extract it:

[source,bash]
----
tar -xzf VMware-vix-disklib-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz
----

You can then specify the library path via:

[source,yaml]
----
conversion_host_vmware_vix_disklib: /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib
----

If you want to skip the `conversion_host` role entirely, specify the library path on the migrator instead:

[source,yaml]
----
import_workloads_libdir: /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib
----

==== Inventory, Variables files and Ansible command:

vcenter_datacenter: Datacenter
----

If you already have a conversion host, or if you want to re-used a previously deployed one:

[source,yaml]
----
already_deploy_conversion_host: true
----

Then specify the Openstack credentials:

[source,yaml]
----
# OpenStack destination cloud auth parameters:
dst_cloud:
  auth:
    auth_url: https://openstack.dst.cloud:13000/v3
    username: tenant
    project_id: xyz
    project_name: migration
    user_domain_name: osm.com
    password: password
  region_name: regionOne
  interface: public
  identity_api_version: 3

# OpenStack migration parameters:
# Use mapped networks or not:
used_mapped_networks: true
network_map:
  VM Network: private

# If no mapped network then set the openstack network:
openstack_private_network: 81cc01d2-5e47-4fad-b387-32686ec71fa4

# Security groups for the instance:
security_groups: 4f077e64-bdf6-4d2a-9f2c-c5588f4948ce
use_existing_flavor: true

os_migrate_create_network_port: false

# OS-migrate parameters:
# osm working directory:
os_migrate_vmw_data_dir: /opt/os-migrate

# Set this to true if the Openstack "dst_cloud" is a clouds.yaml file
# other, if the dest_cloud is a dict of authentication parameters, set
# this to false:
copy_openstack_credentials_to_conv_host: false

# Teardown
# Set to true if you want osm to delete everything on the destination cloud.
os_migrate_tear_down: true

# VMs list
vms_list:
  - rhel-1
  - rhel-2
----

=== OpenStack Flavor

When using VMware as a source, there are several ways to handle the flavor for the resulting OpenStack instance. VMware has no native flavor concept, so OS-Migrate supports:

. Find the closest matching flavor
** Enable:
   [source,yaml]
   ----
   use_existing_flavor: true
   ----
** If no flavor matches, OS‑Migrate will create one automatically.

. Create a new flavor for each VM
** The created flavor name follows:
   `osm-vmware-<vm_name>-<random_id>` (example: `osm-vmware-myvm-9999`).

. Provide a specific flavor UUID
** Force usage of an existing flavor:
   [source,yaml]
   ----
   flavor_uuid: <your_flavor_uuid>
   ----
** Useful to define custom properties for host aggregation or targeted placement.

=== Virt‑v2v

Provide the following additional information when using virt‑v2v:

[source,yaml]
----
# virt‑v2v parameters
vddk_thumbprint: XX:XX:XX
vddk_libdir: /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib
----

Generate the thumbprint of your VMware source cloud with:

[source,bash]
----
openssl s_client -connect ESXI_SERVER_NAME:443 </dev/null | \
  openssl x509 -in /dev/stdin -fingerprint -sha1 -noout
----

=== Running migration from local shared NFS
OS-Migrate can migrate directly from a local shared directory mounted on the
conversion host. If the VMware virtual machines are located on an NFS datastore
that is accessible to the conversion host, you can mount the NFS storage on the
conversion host and provide the path to the NFS mount point.

OS-Migrate will then directly consume the disks of the virtual machines located
on the NFS mount point. Configure the Ansible variable to specify your mount
point as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
import_workloads_local_disk_path: "/srv/nfs"
----

[NOTE]
====
In this mode, only cold migration is supported.
====

=== Ansible configuration

Create an invenvoty file, and replace the conv_host_ip by the ip address of your
conversion host:

[source,yaml]
----
migrator:
  hosts:
    localhost:
      ansible_connection: local
      ansible_python_interpreter: "{{ ansible_playbook_python }}"
conversion_host:
  hosts:
    conv_host_ip:
      ansible_ssh_user: cloud-user
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /home/stack/.ssh/conv-host
----

Then run the migration with:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i localhost_inventory.yml os_migrate.vmware_migration_kit.migration -e @vars.yaml
----

=== Running Migration outside of Ansible

You can also run migration outside of Ansible because the Ansible module are written in Golang.
The binaries are located in the plugins directory.

From your conversion host (or an Openstack instance inside the destination cloud) you need to export
Openstack variables:

[source,bash]
----
 export OS_AUTH_URL=https://keystone-public-openstack.apps.ocp-4-16.standalone
 export OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
 export OS_PASSWORD=admin
 export OS_USERNAME=admin
 export OS_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
 export OS_PROJECT_ID=xyz
----

Then create the argument json file, for example:

[source,json]
----
cat <<EOF > args.json
{
		"user": "root",
		"password": "root",
		"server": "10.0.0.7",
		"vmname": "rhel-9.4-3",
		"cbtsync": false,
		"dst_cloud": {
			"auth": {
				"auth_url": "https://keystone-public-openstack.apps.ocp-4-16.standalone",
				"username": "admin",
				"project_id": "xyz",
				"project_name": "admin",
				"user_domain_name": "Default",
				"password": "admin"
			},
			"region_name": "regionOne",
			"interface": "public",
			"identity_api_version": 3
		}
}
EOF
----

Then execute the `migrate` binary:

[source,bash]
----
pushd vmware-migration-kit/vmware_migration_kit
./plugins/modules/migrate/migrate
----

You can see the logs into:

[source,bash]
----
tail -f /tmp/osm-nbdkit.log
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Connectivity from Conversion Host to VMware

Ensure network and name resolution are properly configured before running migrations.

* Port 902 must be reachable from the conversion host:
  [source,bash]
  ----
  curl -v telnet://<vcenter_ip>:902
  # or
  nc -zv <vcenter_ip> 902
  ----
  The connection should succeed.

* vCenter FQDN resolution
  Ensure the vCenter hostname resolves from the conversion host. If necessary, update `/etc/hosts`:
  [source,bash]
  ----
  echo "<vcenter_ip> vcenter.domain.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
  ----

=== OpenStack Metadata service

If the metadata service is not reachable you may see errors like:

```
Failed to fetch metadata: Get "http://169.254.169.254/openstack/latest/meta_data.json": dial tcp 169.254.169.254:80: connect: no route to host
```

As a workaround you can set a manual instance UUID in the import playbook:

[source,yaml]
----
import_workloads_instance_uuid: <uuid>
----

=== Enable Debugging Flags During Migration

Increase verbosity and capture detailed debug information by setting:

[source,yaml]
----
import_workloads_debug: true
----

OS-Migrate creates a unique log file per migration on the conversion host under `/tmp`, and in case of failure pulls it back to the OS-Migrate work directory (default `/opt/os-migrate`) under a folder named after the VM. The log naming format is:
`osm-nbdkit-<vm-name>-<random-id>.log`.

[source,bash]
----
tail -f /tmp/osm-nbdkit-<vm-name>-<random-id>.log
----

=== NBDKit errors

If you encounter:

```
nbdkit: error: server has no export named '': No such file or directory
```

Common causes:

1. Port 902 not open between conversion host and vCenter.
2. vCenter FQDN not resolvable.
3. Malformed `nbdkit` command (invalid characters or parameters).

=== Manual debug procedure

You can replay the commands manually for troubleshooting.

==== Step 1 – Run `nbdkit` manually

Run the command shown in the logs with `--verbose` and wrap the VMDK path in double quotes:

[source,bash]
----
nbdkit --verbose vddk ".../guest-00001.vmdk"
----

If the migration snapshot has been deleted, remove the snapshot option and use the base disk instead.

==== Step 2 – Run `nbdcopy` in another shell

Run the `nbdcopy` command as shown in the logs and observe `nbdkit` output. You should see:
`vddk: config_complete.`

==== Step 3 – Analyze authentication and paths

At this point, authentication was already verified by the migration process. The VMDK path is returned by the VMware API, typically:
`[Datastore 1] path/to/the/guest-00001.vmdk`.
