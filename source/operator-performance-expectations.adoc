= VMware to OpenStack OS Migrate Performance Expectations

This document outlines some performance expectations for VMware to OpenStack transfers via the os-migrate tooling.
For the purposes of the these metrics, we are considering the following hardware for a Conversion Host:

* 6 vCPU
* 8GB RAM
* 20GB disk unless otherwise stated

//=== VMware to OpenStack via CLI
//
//TODO: Are we to include this?

_All of the below metrics apply to VMware to OpenStack via the Ansible Automation Platform_

== Table 1

Time of execution to completion including instance boot & ping for RHEL machines in our lab.

|===
|VMs|Conversion Hosts|Threads|Time
|1|1|1|2 minutes
|20|1|1|31 minutes
|20|1|2|15 minutes
|30|1|10|8 minutes
|100|1|10|20 minutes
|===

*Note*: The average time for 1 virtual machine is around 2 minutes. The migration can be parallelized on the same conversion host (threads) or on multiple conversion hosts.

== Table 2

Time for RHEL machines with a larger disk for a full migration run with and without CBTfootnote:[CBT = https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/320557/changed-block-tracking-cbt-on-virtual-ma.html] options:

|===
|Disk size|CBT enabled|Time total|Cutover time|Expected downtime
|100 GB|yes|8 minutes|2 minutes|2 minutes
|100 GB|no|7 minutes||7 minutes
|200 GB|yes|10 minutes 30 secondes|2 minutes|2 minutes
|200 GB|no|9 minutes 30 secondes||9 minutes 30 secondes
|300 GB|yes|17 minutes|2 minutes|2 minutes
|300 GB|no|15 minutes||15 minutes
|1 TB|yes|39 minutes|2 minutes|2 minutes
|1 TB|no|35 minutes||35 minutes
|===

*Note 1*: The disks are 99% full of random data during the test.

*Note 2*: The CBT option takes a bit more time overall but the downtime is actually lower due to the smaller data cutover time.

== Table 3

Example of a Migration plan for 55 VMs with 200 GB of disk full. _(estimation)_

|===
|Disk size|Conversion Hosts|Threads|CBT enabled|Migration time|Sync time
|200 GB|1|1|yes|115 minutes|
|200 GB|1|5|no|105 minutes|
|200 GB|1|5|yes|22 minutes|110 minutes
|===

For this example, the best plan is to parallelize the migration on a single Conversion Host to 5 threads and use the CBT option to pre-migrate the volume data; this will shortern the cutover time (2 minutes in our lab environment), reducing the downtime overall.

== Table 4

Migration of 1500 VMs: Time for RHEL machines in our lab with a disk capacity of 20GB, with a full migration run which comprises of migration of data, conversion and instance creation, boot time, and ability to ping.

|===
|VMs|Conversion Hosts|Threads|Time
|250|2|6|60 minutes (without the preparation steps)
|1000|2|6|5 hours
|1500|2|6|
|===

*Note 1*: The conversion flavor was set to: *12GB of RAM and 6 vcpus* which allow OS-Migrate to comfortably run 6 migrations in parallel on the same host. There is space to execute more parallel migrations with this configuration but it's a best practice to let 2GB of RAM and 1 CPU for each migration.

== Conversion host requirements and recommendations

Recommended guidelines:

* *For 1 migration allocate 2GB of RAM and 1 vCPU on your Conversion Host*
* RHEL 9.5 or CentOS 10 to benefit from the latest drivers (virtio-win) to convert the recent Windows distributions.
* Fedora (38 and +) if you want to convert btrfs file system

*Minimum baseline for small concurrency*: 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM, 16GB disk on the conversion host.

== How to proceed with a large workload

It's important to first focus on sizing your target OpenStack environment adequately. It will of course receive large numbers of instances, ports, volumes, floating ips and all the OpenStack resources that the instances will require. So set the OpenStack quotas with the correct values.

Second you need to split your workload regarding the number of conversion hosts you will create.

For example, with a workload of 1000 VMs, you can use two conversion hosts which will run the migration in parallel and execute 5 or 6 migrations simultaneously on each conversion host.

If you followed the requirements for the conversion host above, the migration time will be linear:

If 1 virtual machine takes 5 minutes to be migrated then the 1000 Vms will take:

* 5*1000/12 (where 12 is 6 parallel migrations x 2 conversion hosts): 6 hours and 56 minutes

The more you divide your workload, the faster you will move it to OpenStack.

In the example above, if we decide to add 2 more conversion hosts then:

* 5*1000/24 = 3h and 28 minutes.

Finally, some known issues we have seen may happen during a large-scale migration.

* First, when the conversion hosts are too solicited. For example, a single conversion host which has performed more than 5 000 of migrations in a very short time may have some issues with the device mount mechanism in the OS itself.

When this behavior appears, sometimes just a reboot might help to clean the /dev/ devices.

* Another issue may appear on the Vmware side with the message "snapshot hierarchy is too deep" because OS-Migrate is working with Snapshot. If this error appears, then clean the guest snapshots hierarchy and re-run the migration.

*Note 1* - Make sure all the OpenStack services are configured to support a large amount of requests. OS-Migrate is driven by Ansible but the core of the migration is a binary which does not consume a lot of resources. So the more you use the binary, the more the OpenStack Api will receive requests. For example Rabbitmq, Galera and also Nova or Cinder will be impacted.
